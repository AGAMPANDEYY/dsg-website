## Projects  
- **Image-Alchemy: Personalized Text-to-Image Generation**  
  Developed a two-stage pipeline using LoRA-tuned SDXL and segmentation-driven Img2Img to enhance subject fidelity. Achieved a DINO similarity score of 0.789. *(ICLR DeLTa Workshop 2025)*  

- **AI Image Classification & Artifact Detection**  
  Created a dataset and trained ConvNeXt to differentiate real vs. AI-generated images. Used adversarial training, CLIP embeddings, and diffusion-based upscaling. *(Inter IIT Tech Meet 13.0, IIT Bombay, 2024)*  

- **Multimodal Emotion Recognition**  
  Built a model combining 3D ResNet-18 (video) and HuBERT Transformer (audio) with self/cross-attention, achieving 98.47% accuracy on Crema-D and 95.65% on Ravdess. *(IIT Roorkee, 2025)*  

- **NeurIPS Ariel Data Challenge**  
  Conducted EDA and transit depth analysis on exoplanet data using ML techniques. Ranked 227 globally on Kaggle. *(NeurIPS 2024)*
