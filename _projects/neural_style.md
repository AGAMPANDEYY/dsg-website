Itâ€™s all about cool stuff with Neural Style.

This is a Keras implementation of neural style described in the paper by [Gatys et.al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576) The main objective of neural style is to generate an image that is as close as in terms of content to the base image and as close as in terms of style to the style image.
