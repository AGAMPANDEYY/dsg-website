# Fortnite AI Agent Using DreamerV3

This project focuses on developing an AI agent capable of playing Fortnite by leveraging the DreamerV3 reinforcement learning algorithm. DreamerV3 is a model-based reinforcement learning approach that learns an internal model of the environment and uses it to simulate future scenarios, enabling the agent to plan and make informed decisions. citeturn0search2

## Features

- **Model-Based Learning**: Utilizes DreamerV3 to build a world model from visual inputs, facilitating efficient learning and decision-making.
- **Direct Interaction**: Interacts with Fortnite through real-time screen capture and input simulation, eliminating the need for game source code or APIs. citeturn0search1
- **Scalability**: Designed to train on a single GPU, making it accessible for developers with limited computational resources.
