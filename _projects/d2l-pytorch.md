This project is adapted from the original Dive Into Deep Learning book by Aston Zhang, Zachary C. Lipton, Mu Li, Alex J. Smola and all the community contributors. GitHub of the original book: https://github.com/d2l-ai/d2l-en. We have made an effort to modify the book and convert the MXnet code snippets into PyTorch.
